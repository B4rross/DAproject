\item \mbox{[}T1.\+1\+: 1.\+0 point\mbox{]} Obviously, a first task will be to create a simple interface menu exposing all the functionalities implemented in the most user-\/friendly way possible. This menu will also be instrumental for you to showcase the work you have developed in a short demo to be held at the end of the project.
\item \mbox{[}T1.\+2\+: 1.\+0 point\mbox{]} Similarly, you will also have to develop some basic functionality (accessible through your menu) to read and parse the provided data set files. This functionality will enable you (and the eventual user) to select alternative railway networks for analysis. With the extracted information, you are to create one (or more) appropriate graphs upon which you will carry out the requested tasks. The modelling of the graph is entirely up to you, so long as it is a sensible representation of the railway network and enables the correct application of the required algorithms.
\item \mbox{[}T1.\+3\+: 2.\+0 points\mbox{]} In addition, you should also include documentation of all the implemented code, using Doxygen, indicating for each implemented algorithm the corresponding time complexity
\item \mbox{[}T2.\+1\+: 3.\+5 points\mbox{]} \+:heavy\+\_\+check\+\_\+mark\+: Calculate the maximum number of trains that can simultaneously travel between two specific stations. Note that your implementation should take any valid source and destination stations as input; ~\newline

\item \mbox{[}T2.\+2\+: 2.\+0 points\mbox{]} \+:heavy\+\_\+check\+\_\+mark\+: Determine, from all pairs of stations, which ones (if more than one) require the most amount of trains when taking full advantage of the existing network capacity;
\item \mbox{[}T2.\+3\+: 1.\+5 points\mbox{]} Indicate where management should assign larger budgets for the purchasing and maintenance of trains. That is, your implementation should be able to report the top-\/k municipalities and districts, regarding their transportation needs;
\item \mbox{[}T2.\+4\+: 1 point\mbox{]} \+:heavy\+\_\+check\+\_\+mark\+: Report the maximum number of trains that can simultaneously arrive at a given station, taking into consideration the entire railway grid
\item \mbox{[}T3.\+1\+: 2.\+0 points\mbox{]} Calculate the maximum amount of trains that can simultaneously travel between two specific stations with minimum cost for the company. Note that your system should also take any valid source and destination stations as input;
\item \mbox{[}T4.\+1\+: 2.\+5 points\mbox{]} Calculate the maximum number of trains that can simultaneously travel between two specific stations in a network of reduced connectivity. Reduced connectivity is understood as being a subgraph (generated by your system) of the original railway network. Note that your system should also take any valid source and destination stations as input;
\item \mbox{[}T4.\+2\+: 1.\+5 points\mbox{]} Provide a report on the stations that are the most affected by each segment failure, i.\+e., the top-\/k most affected stations for each segment to be considered
\item \mbox{[}T5.\+1\+: 2.\+0 points\mbox{]} Use the (hopefully) user-\/friendly interface you have developed to illustrate the various algorithm results for a sample set of railway grids which you should develop specifically for the purposes of this demo. For instance, you can develop a small set of very modest railway networks for contrived capacities so that you can highlight the “correctness” of your solution. For instance, a grid that has a “constricted” segment where all traffic must go through, will clearly have a segment very “sensitive” to failures.
